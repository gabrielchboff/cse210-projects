Project Idea: Password Manager

Description:
Create a password manager utility that securely stores and manages user passwords for diverse debts. The utility should provide capabilities including password generation, encryption, decryption, and secure login.

Classes:

1. User: Represents a user of the password manager, with attributes like username, master password (used to access the password manager), and stored passwords.
2. PasswordEntry: Represents a stored password access, containing attributes like account call, username, password, and optional extra facts.
3. PasswordManager: Manages the middle functionalities of the password supervisor software, consisting of encryption, decryption, password era, and user authentication.
4. UserInterface: Handles the consumer interface interactions, permitting customers to log in, view saved passwords, add new passwords, generate passwords, and many others.
5. EncryptionManager: Manages encryption and decryption operations to soundly shop and retrieve password facts.
6. PasswordGenerator: Generates robust, random passwords in keeping with consumer-described standards.
7. SecurityManager: Implements protection features including password power evaluation, hashing, and salting to beautify the safety of stored passwords.
8. Menu: Handles the menu interactions and generates a menu.

Abstraction:
Classes like PasswordManager, EncryptionManager, and PasswordGenerator abstract away the complexities of coping with passwords and encryption, offering simplified interfaces for users.

Encapsulation:
Internal information of instructions are encapsulated, with non-public fields and homes. 
External techniques offer public behaviors for interacting with the classes.

Inheritance:
Base training like User can be prolonged to create specialized person kinds or roles with additional functionalities.

Polymorphism:
Methods like "GeneratePassword()"; can be defined in base training and overridden in derived instructions to provide special password era algorithms or techniques.
This challenge idea lets in you to create a steady and person-friendly password supervisor application that demonstrates various security ideas, such as encryption,hashing, password energy evaluation, and stable person authentication.
