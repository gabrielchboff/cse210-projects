Abstraction is a concept that involves simplifying complex concepts by breaking them down into manageable and understandable parts. This methodology reduces the complexity and enhance understanding.One key advantage of abstraction is that it 
allows consumers to interact with products without needing to understand their internal workings. 
This simplification enables more sophisticated and user-friendly interactions with computers and applications
. By using abstraction, designers can create systems that are more modular, easier to maintain, and more flexible, and
even more generic. This benefit extends to various fields, from software engineering to digital design, 
where abstraction serves as a powerful tool for unlocking the full potential of complex systems. Using
Abstraction we reproduces the fuctionality how works the things in the real life inserting the concept in the
computer world facilitating the understandig to any human. Beacause It is possible to create many libraries and
dependencies to use in various projects. This concept is used to integrate system, build APIs and Desktop applications.
For example of abstraction, in the Jounal Project I create a class called Journal, after the abstraction I realize that
a Journal is made of pages, in other words a collection of entries, to maximize the abstraction I created a class called
Entry with all attributes related with the entry, after I created a list of entries, This maximize the understanding of
the Journal class. 
In summary, abstraction is a crucial concept that simplifies complex systems. It allows developers to focus on 
functionality without being burdened by intricate implementation details, and it promotes modularity, 
code reusability, and efficient development.
