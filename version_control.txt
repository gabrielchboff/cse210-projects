Version control is a fundamental concept that manages source code through different versions.
It operates on the premise that each software iteration possesses distinct features and fixes, 
all tracked through versions. Numerous tools facilitate this practice, with "git" being one of the most renowned. 
The advantages of version control include enhanced readability, bug containment,
a reliable backup system, and the ability to revert to previous versions in case of errors.
 Moreover, it simplifies collaboration by employing the concept of branches. In this model,
 the code follows a linear progression, but developers can create branches to diverge from this main line,
 allowing for independent work that can later be merged back through pull requests.

To harness this powerful concept effectively, feature branches are commonly utilized. 
To create a repository and a branch using "git," follow these commands:
- Create a repository: `git init;`
- Make a commit (to save changes and create a version): `git commit -m "your message";`
- Establish a branch: `git checkout -b your_branch_name`.
